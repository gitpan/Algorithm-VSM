######################  Relevance Judgments for Testing Purposes   #######################

## IMPORTANT: This estimation of document relevancies to queries is NOT for
##            serious work.  A document is considered to be relevant to a
##            query if it contains several of the query words.  As to the
##            minimum number of query words that must exist in a document
##            in order for the latter to be considered relevant is
##            determined by the relevancy_threshold parameter in the VSM
##            constructor.  (See the relevancy and precision-recall related
##            scripts in the 'examples' directory.)  The reason for why the
##            function shown below is not for serious work is because
##            ultimately it is the humans who are the best judges of the
##            relevancies of documents to queries.  The humans bring to
##            bear semantic considerations on the relevancy determination
##            problem that are beyond the scope of this module.

                           want_stemming            => 1,

        $vsm->display_normalized_doc_vectors();
        my $retrievals = $vsm->retrieve_for_query_with_vsm( \@query );
        $vsm->display_retrievals( $retrievals );

     The constructor parameter 'corpus_directory' is for naming the root of
     the directory whose VSM model you wish to construct.  The optional
     parameters 'corpus_vocab_db', 'doc_vectors_db', and
     'normalized_doc_vecs_db' are for naming disk-based databases in which
     the VSM model will be stored.  Subsequently, these databases can be
     used for much faster retrieval from the same corpus.  You need to set
     these parameters only if you have set the save_model_on_disk option in
     the constructor call.  The parameter 'want_stemming' means that you
     would want the words in the documents to be stemmed to their root
     forms before the VSM model is constructed.  Stemming will reduce all
     words such as 'programming,' 'programs,' 'program,' etc. to the same
     root word 'program.'  The parameter break_camelcased_and_underscored
     when set will cause all underscored and camel-cased words to be split.
     The functions display_corpus_vocab() and display_doc_vectors() are
     there only for testing purposes with small corpora.  If you must use
     them for large libraries/corpora, you might wish to redirect the
     output to a file.

     By default, a call to any of the constructors will calculate
     normalized term-frequency vectors for the documents.  Normalization
     consists of first calculating the term frequency tf(t) of a term t in
     a document as a proportion of the total numbers of words in the
     document and then multiplying it by idf(t), where idf(t) stands for
     the inverse document frequency associated with that term.  Note that
     'word' and 'term' mean the same thing.

    The initialization code before the constructor call and the calls for
    displaying the vocabulary and the vectors after the call remain the
    same as for the previous case.  In the calls above, the constructor
    parameter lsa_svd_threshold determines how many of the singular values
    will be retained after we have carried out an SVD decomposition of the
    term-frequency matrix for the documents in the corpus.  Singular values
    smaller than this threshold fraction of the largest value are rejected.
    The parameters that end in '_db' are optional and are there for naming
    the database files in which the basic information about the model is
    stored when the parameter save_model_on_disk is set, as explained for
    the previous constructor call.

      Measuring precision and recall requires a set of queries.  These are
      supplied through the constructor parameter 'query_file'.  The format
      of the this file must be according to the sample file
      'test_queries.txt' in the 'examples' directory.  The module estimates
      the relevancies of the documents to the queries and dumps the
      relevancies in a file named by the 'relevancy_file' constructor
      parameter.  The constructor parameter 'relevancy_threshold' is used
      in deciding which of the documents are considered to be relevant to a
      query.  A document must contain at least the 'relevancy_threshold'
      occurrences of query words in order to be considered relevant to a
      query.

      We have already explained the purpose of the constructor parameter
      'query_file' and about the constraints on the format of queries in
      the file named through this parameter.  As mentioned earlier, the
      module estimates the relevancies of the documents to the queries and
      dumps the relevancies in a file named by the 'relevancy_file'
      constructor parameter.  The constructor parameter
      'relevancy_threshold' is used in deciding which of the documents are
      considered to be relevant to a query.  A document must contain at
      least the 'relevancy_threshold' occurrences of query words in order
      to be considered relevant to a query.  We have previously explained
      the role of the constructor parameter 'lsa_svd_threshold'.

    Now the filename supplied through the constructor parameter

=head1 CHANGES

Version 1.50 incorporates a couple of new features: (1) You now have the
option to split camel-cased and underscored words for constructing your
vocabulary set; and (2) Storing the VSM and LSA models in database files on
the disk is now optional.  The second feature, in particular, should prove
useful to those who are using this module for large collections of
documents.

Version 1.42 includes two new methods, C<display_corpus_vocab_size()> and
C<write_corpus_vocab_to_file()>, for those folks who deal with very large datasets.
You can get a better sense of the overall vocabulary being used by the module for
file retrieval by examining the contents of a dump file whose name is supplied as an
argument to C<write_corpus_vocab_to_file()>.

Version 1.41 downshifts the required version of the PDL module. Also cleaned up are
the dependencies between this module and the submodules of PDL.

Version 1.4 makes it easier for a user to calculate a similarity matrix over all the
documents in the corpus. The elements of such a matrix express pairwise similarities
between the documents.  The pairwise similarities are based on the dot product of two
document vectors divided by the product of the vector magnitudes.  The 'examples'
directory contains two scripts to illustrate how such matrices can be calculated by
the user.  The similarity matrix is output as a CSV file.

Version 1.3 incorporates IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) weighting of the words in a
document file. What that means is that the words that appear in most of the documents
get reduced weighting since such words are non-discriminatory with respect to the
retrieval of the documents. A typical formula that is used to calculate the IDF
weight for a word is the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents to
the number of documents in which the word appears.  So if a word were to appear in
all the documents, its IDF multiplier would be zero in the vector representation of a
document.  If so desired, you can turn off the IDF weighting of the words by
explicitly setting the constructor parameter C<use_idf_filter> to zero.

Version 1.2 includes a code correction and some general code and documentation
cleanup.

With Version 1.1, you can access the retrieval precision results so that you can
compare two different retrieval algorithms (VSM or LSA with different choices for
some of the constructor parameters) with significance testing. (Version 1.0 merely
sent those results to standard output, typically your terminal window.)  In Version
1.1, the new script B<significance_testing.pl> in the 'examples' directory
illustrates significance testing with Randomization and with Student's Paired t-Test.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Algorithm::VSM> is a I<perl5> module for constructing a Vector Space Model (VSM) or
a Latent Semantic Analysis Model (LSA) of a collection of documents, usually referred
to as a corpus, and then retrieving the documents in response to search words in a
query.

VSM and LSA models have been around for a long time in the Information Retrieval (IR)
community.  More recently such models have been shown to be effective in retrieving
files/documents from software libraries. For an account of this research that was
presented by Shivani Rao and the author of this module at the 2011 Mining Software
Repositories conference, see L<http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1985451>.

VSM modeling consists of: (1) Extracting the vocabulary used in a corpus.  (2)
Stemming the words so extracted and eliminating the designated stop words from the
vocabulary.  Stemming means that closely related words like 'programming' and
'programs' are reduced to the common root word 'program' and the stop words are the
non-discriminating words that can be expected to exist in virtually all the
documents. (3) Constructing document vectors for the individual files in the corpus
--- the document vectors taken together constitute what is usually referred to as a
'term-frequency' matrix for the corpus. (4) Normalizing the document vectors to
factor out the effect of document size and, if desired, multiplying the term
frequencies by the IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) values for the words to reduce
the weight of the words that appear in a large number of documents. (5) Constructing
a query vector for the search query after the query is subject to the same stemming
and stop-word elimination rules that were applied to the corpus. And, lastly, (6)
Using a similarity metric to return the set of documents that are most similar to the
query vector.  The commonly used similarity metric is one based on the cosine
distance between two vectors.  Also note that all the vectors mentioned here are of
the same size, the size of the vocabulary.  An element of a vector is the frequency
of occurrence of the word corresponding to that position in the vector.

LSA modeling is a small variation on VSM modeling.  Now you take VSM modeling one
step further by subjecting the term-frequency matrix for the corpus to singular value
decomposition (SVD).  By retaining only a subset of the singular values (usually the
N largest for some value of N), you can construct reduced-dimensionality vectors for
the documents and the queries.  In VSM, as mentioned above, the size of the document
and the query vectors is equal to the size of the vocabulary.  For large corpora,
this size may involve tens of thousands of words --- this can slow down the VSM
modeling and retrieval process.  So you are very likely to get faster performance
with retrieval based on LSA modeling, especially if you store the model once
constructed in a database file on the disk and carry out retrievals using the
disk-based model.


=head1 CAN THIS MODULE BE USED FOR GENERAL TEXT RETRIEVAL?

This module has only been tested for software retrieval.  For more general text
retrieval, you would need to replace the simple stemmer used in the module by one
based on, say, Porter's Stemming Algorithm.  You would also need to vastly expand the
list of stop words appropriate to the text corpora of interest to you. As previously
mentioned, the stop words are the commonly occurring words that do not carry much
discriminatory power from the standpoint of distinguishing between the documents.
See the file 'stop_words.txt' in the 'examples' directory for how such a file must be
formatted.


=head1 HOW DOES ONE DEAL WITH VERY LARGE LIBRARIES/CORPORA?

It is not uncommon for large software libraries to consist of tens of thousands of
documents that include source-code files, documentation files, README files,
configuration files, etc.  The bug-localization work presented recently by Shivani
Rao and this author at the 2011 Mining Software Repository conference (MSR11) was
based on a relatively small iBUGS dataset involving 6546 documents and a vocabulary
size of 7553 unique words. (Here is a link to this work:
L<http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1985451>.  Also note that the iBUGS dataset
was originally put together by V. Dallmeier and T. Zimmermann for the evaluation of
automated bug detection and localization tools.)  If C<V> is the size of the
vocabulary and C<M> the number of the documents in the corpus, the size of each
vector will be C<V> and size of the term-frequency matrix for the entire corpus will
be C<V>xC<M>.  So if you were to duplicate the bug localization experiments in
L<http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1985451> you would be dealing with vectors of
size 7553 and a term-frequency matrix of size 7553x6546.  Extrapolating these numbers
to really large libraries/corpora, we are obviously talking about very large matrices
for SVD decomposition.  For large libraries/corpora, it would be best to store away
the model in a disk file and to base all subsequent retrievals on the disk-stored
models.  The 'examples' directory contains scripts that carry out retrievals on the
basis of disk-based models.  Further speedup in retrieval can be achieved by using
LSA to create reduced-dimensionality representations for the documents and by basing
retrievals on the stored versions of such reduced-dimensionality representations.


=head1 ESTIMATING RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE WITH PRECISION VS. RECALL CALCULATIONS

The performance of a retrieval algorithm is typically measured by two properties:
C<Precision at rank> and C<Recall at rank>.  As mentioned in the
L<http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1985451> publication, at a given rank C<r>,
C<Precision> is the ratio of the number of retrieved documents that are relevant to
the total number of retrieved documents up to that rank.  And, along the same lines,
C<Recall> at a given rank C<r> is the ratio of the number of retrieved documents that
are relevant to the total number of relevant documents.  The area under the
C<Precision>--C<Recall> curve is called the C<Average Precision> for a query.  When
the C<Average Precision> is averaged over all the queries, we obtain what is known as
C<Mean Average Precision> (MAP).  For an oracle, the value of MAP should be 1.0.  On
the other hand, for purely random retrieval from a corpus, the value of MAP will be
inversely proportional to the size of the corpus.  (See the discussion in
L<https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/Tutorials/SignificanceTesting.pdf> for further
explanation on these retrieval precision evaluators.)  This module includes methods
that allow you to carry out these retrieval accuracy measurements using the relevancy
judgments supplied through a disk file.  If human-supplied relevancy judgments are
not available, the module will be happy to estimate relevancies for you just by
determining the number of query words that exist in a document.  Note, however, that
relevancy judgments estimated in this manner cannot be trusted. That is because
ultimately it is the humans who are the best judges of the relevancies of documents
to queries.  The humans bring to bear semantic considerations on the relevancy
determination problem that are beyond the scope of this module.


=head1 METHODS

The module provides the following methods for constructing VSM and LSA models of a
corpus, for using the models thus constructed for retrieval, and for carrying out
precision versus recall calculations for the determination of retrieval accuracy on
the corpora of interest to you.

=over

=item B<new():>

A call to C<new()> constructs a new instance of the C<Algorithm::VSM> class:

    my $vsm = Algorithm::VSM->new( 
                     break_camelcased_and_underscored  => 1, 
                     corpus_directory       => "",
                     corpus_vocab_db        => "corpus_vocab_db",
                     doc_vectors_db         => "doc_vectors_db",
                     lsa_svd_threshold      => 0.01, 
                     max_number_retrievals  => 10,
                     min_word_length        => 4,
                     normalized_doc_vecs_db => "normalized_doc_vecs_db",
                     query_file             => "",  
                     relevancy_file         => $relevancy_file,
                     relevancy_threshold    => 5, 
                     save_model_on_disk     => 1,  
                     stop_words_file        => "", 
                     use_idf_filter         => 1,
                     want_stemming          => 1,
              );       

The values shown on the right side of the big arrows are the B<default values for the
parameters>.  The following nested list will now describe each of the constructor
parameters:

=over 16

=item I<break_camelcased_and_underscored:>

The parameter B<break_camelcased_and_underscored> when set causes the
underscored and camel-cased words to be split.  By default the parameter is
set.  So if you don't want such words to be split, you must set it
explicitly to 0.

=item I<corpus_directory:>

The parameter B<corpus_directory> points to the root of the directory of documents
for which you want to create a VSM or LSA model.

=item I<corpus_vocab_db:>

The parameter B<corpus_vocab_db> is for naming the DBM in which the corpus vocabulary
will be stored after it is subject to stemming and the elimination of stop words.
Once a disk-based VSM model is created and stored away in the file named by this
parameter and the parameter to be described next, it can subsequently be used
directly for speedier retrieval.

=item I<doc_vectors_db:>

The database named by B<doc_vectors_db> stores the document vector representation for
each document in the corpus.  Each document vector has the same size as the
corpus-wide vocabulary; each element of such a vector is the number of occurrences of
the word that corresponds to that position in the vocabulary vector.

=item I<lsa_svd_threshold:>

The parameter B<lsa_svd_threshold> is used for rejecting singular values that are
smaller than this threshold fraction of the largest singular value.  This plays a
critical role in creating reduced-dimensionality document vectors in LSA modeling of
a corpus.

=item I<max_number_retrievals:>

The constructor parameter B<max_number_retrievals> stands for what it means.

=item I<min_word_length:> 

The parameter B<min_word_length> sets the minimum number of characters in a
word in order for it to be included in the corpus vocabulary.

=item I<normalized_doc_vecs_db:>

The database named by B<normalized_doc_vecs_db> stores the normalized document
vectors.  Normalization consists of factoring out the size of the documents by
dividing the term frequency for each word in a document by the number of words in the
document, and then multiplying the result by the idf (Inverse Document Frequency)
value for the word.

=item I<query_file:>

The parameter B<query_file> points to a file that contains the queries to be used for
calculating retrieval performance with C<Precision> and C<Recall> numbers. The format
of the query file must be as shown in the sample file C<test_queries.txt> in the
'examples' directory.

=item I<relevancy_file:> 

This option names the disk file for storing the relevancy judgments.

=item I<relevancy_threshold:> 

The constructor parameter B<relevancy_threshold> is used for automatic determination
of document relevancies to queries on the basis of the number of occurrences of query
words in a document.  You can exercise control over the process of determining
relevancy of a document to a query by giving a suitable value to the constructor
parameter B<relevancy_threshold>.  A document is considered relevant to a query only
when the document contains at least B<relevancy_threshold> number of query words.

=item I<save_model_on_disk:>

The constructor parameter B<save_model_on_disk> will cause the basic
information about the VSM and the LSA models to be stored on the disk.
Subsequently, any retrievals can be carried out from the disk-based model.

=item I<stop_words_file:>

The parameter B<stop_words_file> is for naming the file that contains the stop words
that you do not wish to include in the corpus vocabulary.  The format of this file
must be as shown in the sample file C<stop_words.txt> in the 'examples' directory.

=item I<use_idf_filter:>

The constructor parameter B<use_idf_filter> is set by default.  If you want
to turn off the normalization of the document vectors, including turning
off the weighting of the term frequencies of the words by their idf values,
you must set this parameter explicitly to 0.

=item I<want_stemming:>

The boolean parameter B<want_stemming> determines whether or not the words extracted
from the documents would be subject to stemming.  As mentioned elsewhere, stemming
means that related words like 'programming' and 'programs' would both be reduced to
the root word 'program'.

=back

=begin html

<br>

=end html

=item B<construct_lsa_model():>

You call this subroutine for constructing an LSA model for your corpus
after you have extracted the corpus vocabulary and constructed document
vectors:

    $vsm->construct_lsa_model();

The SVD decomposition that is carried out in LSA model construction uses the
constructor parameter C<lsa_svd_threshold> to decide how many of the singular values
to retain for the LSA model.  A singular is retained only if it is larger than the
C<lsa_svd_threshold> fraction of the largest singular value.


=item B<display_corpus_vocab():>

If you would like to see corpus vocabulary as constructed by the previous call, make
the call

    $vsm->display_corpus_vocab();

Note that this is a useful thing to do only on small test corpora. If you need
to examine the vocabulary for a large corpus, call the two methods listed below.


=item B<display_corpus_vocab_size():>

If you would like for the module to print out in your terminal window the size of the
vocabulary, make the call

    $vsm->display_corpus_vocab_size();


=item B<display_doc_relevancies():>

If you would like to see the document relevancies generated by the previous method,
you can call

    $vsm->display_doc_relevancies()


=item B<display_doc_vectors():>

If you would like to see the document vectors constructed by the previous call, make
the call:

    $vsm->display_doc_vectors();

Note that this is a useful thing to do only on small test corpora. If you must call
this method on a large corpus, you might wish to direct the output to a file.  


=item B<display_inverse_document_frequencies():>

You can display the idf value associated with each word in the corpus by

    $vsm->display_inverse_document_frequencies();

The idf of a word in the corpus is calculated typically as the logarithm of the ratio
of the total number of documents in the corpus to the number of documents in which
the word appears (with protection built in to prevent division by zero).  Ideally, if
a word appears in all the documents, its idf would be small, close to zero. Words
with small idf values are non-discriminatory and should get reduced weighting in
document retrieval.


=item B<display_map_values_for_queries():>

The area under the precision vs. recall curve for a given query is called C<Average
Precision> for that query.  When this area is averaged over all the queries, you get
C<MAP> (Mean Average Precision) as a measure of the accuracy of the retrieval
algorithm.  The C<Average Precision> values for the queries and the overall C<MAP>
can be printed out by calling

    $vsm->display_map_values_for_queries();


=item B<display_normalized_doc_vectors():>

If you would like to see the normalized document vectors, make the call:

    $vsm->display_normalized_doc_vectors();

See the comment made previously as to what is meant by the normalization of a
document vector.


=item B<display_precision_vs_recall_for_queries():>

A call to C<precision_and_recall_calculator()> will normally be followed by the
following call

    $vsm->display_precision_vs_recall_for_queries();

for displaying the C<Precision@rank> and C<Recall@rank> values.


=item B<display_retrievals( $retrievals ):>

You can display the retrieved document names by calling this method using the syntax:

    $vsm->display_retrievals( $retrievals );

where C<$retrievals> is a reference to the hash returned by a call to one of the
C<retrieve> methods.  The display method shown here respects the retrieval size
constraints expressed by the constructor parameter C<max_number_retrievals>.


=item B<estimate_doc_relevancies():>

Before you can carry out precision and recall calculations to test the accuracy of
VSM and LSA based retrievals from a corpus, you need to have available the relevancy
judgments for the queries.  (A relevancy judgment for a query is simply the list of
documents relevant to that query.)  Relevancy judgments are commonly supplied by the
humans who are familiar with the corpus.  But if such human-supplied relevance
judgments are not available, you can invoke the following method to estimate them:

    $vsm->estimate_doc_relevancies();

For the above method call, a document is considered to be relevant to a query if it
contains several of the query words.  As to the minimum number of query words that
must exist in a document in order for the latter to be considered relevant, that is
determined by the C<relevancy_threshold> parameter in the VSM constructor.

But note that this estimation of document relevancies to queries is NOT for serious
work.  The reason for that is because ultimately it is the humans who are the best
judges of the relevancies of documents to queries.  The humans bring to bear semantic
considerations on the relevancy determination problem that are beyond the scope of
this module.

The generated relevancies are deposited in a file named by the constructor parameter
C<relevancy_file>.


=item B<get_all_document_names():>

If you want to get hold of all the filenames in the corpus in your own script, you
can call

    my @docs = @{$vsm->get_all_document_names()};

The array on the left will contain an alphabetized list of the files.


=item B<generate_document_vectors():>

This is a necessary step after the vocabulary used by a corpus is constructed. (Of
course, if you will be doing document retrieval through a disk-stored VSM or LSA
model, then you do not need to call this method.  You construct document vectors
through the following call:

    $vsm->generate_document_vectors();


=item B<get_corpus_vocabulary_and_word_counts():>

After you have constructed a new instance of the C<Algorithm::VSM> class, you must
now scan the corpus documents for constructing the corpus vocabulary. This you do by:

    $vsm->get_corpus_vocabulary_and_word_counts();

The only time you do NOT need to call this method is when you are using a previously
constructed disk-stored VSM model for retrieval.


=item B<get_query_sorted_average_precision_for_queries():>

If you want to run significance tests on the retrieval accuracies you obtain on a
given corpus and with different algorithms (VSM or LSA with different choices for the
constructor parameters), your own script would need access to the average precision
data for a set of queries. You can get hold of this data by calling

    $vsm->get_query_sorted_average_precision_for_queries();

The script C<significance_testing.pl> in the 'examples' directory shows how you can
use this method for significance testing.


=item B<pairwise_similarity_for_docs():>

=item B<pairwise_similarity_for_normalized_docs():>

If you would like to compare in your own script any two documents in the corpus, you
can call

    my $similarity = $vsm->pairwise_similarity_for_docs("filename_1", "filename_2");
or
    my $similarity = $vsm->pairwise_similarity_for_normalized_docs("filename_1", "filename_2");

Both these calls return a number that is the dot product of the two document vectors
normalized by the product of their magnitudes.  The first call uses the regular
document vectors and the second the normalized document vectors.


=item B<precision_and_recall_calculator():>

After you have created or obtained the relevancy judgments for your test queries, you
can make the following call to calculate C<Precision@rank> and C<Recall@rank>:

    $vsm->precision_and_recall_calculator('vsm');
or 
    $vsm->precision_and_recall_calculator('lsa');

depending on whether you are testing VSM-based retrieval or LSA-based retrieval.

=item B<retrieve_with_lsa():>

After you have built an LSA model through the call to C<construct_lsa_model()>, you
can retrieve the document names most similar to the query by:

    my $retrievals = $vsm->retrieve_with_lsa( \@query );

Subsequently, you can display the retrievals by calling the
C<display_retrievals($retrieval)> method described previously.


=item B<retrieve_with_vsm():>

After you have constructed a VSM model, you call this method for document retrieval
for a given query C<@query>.  The call syntax is:

    my $retrievals = $vsm->retrieve_with_vsm( \@query );

The argument, C<@query>, is simply a list of words that you wish to use for
retrieval. The method returns a hash whose keys are the document names and whose
values the similarity distance between the document and the query.  As is commonly
the case with VSM, this module uses the cosine similarity distance when comparing a
document vector with the query vector.


=item B<upload_document_relevancies_from_file():>

When human-supplied relevancies are available, you can upload them into the program
by calling

    $vsm->upload_document_relevancies_from_file();

These relevance judgments will be read from a file that is named with the
C<relevancy_file> constructor parameter.


=item B<upload_normalized_vsm_model_from_disk():>

When you invoke the methods C<get_corpus_vocabulary_and_word_counts()> and
C<generate_document_vectors()>, that automatically deposits the VSM model in the
database files named with the constructor parameters C<corpus_vocab_db>,
C<doc_vectors_db> and C<normalized_doc_vecs_db>.  Subsequently, you can carry out
retrieval by directly using this disk-based VSM model for speedier performance.  In
order to do so, you must upload the disk-based model by

    $vsm->upload_normalized_vsm_model_from_disk();

Subsequently you call 

    my $retrievals = $vsm->retrieve_with_vsm( \@query );
    $vsm->display_retrievals( $retrievals );

for retrieval and for displaying the results.  


=item B<write_corpus_vocab_to_file():>

This is the method to call for large text corpora if you would like to examine the
vocabulary created. The call syntax is

    $vsm->write_corpus_vocab_to_file($filename);

where C<$filename> is the name of the file that you want the vocabulary to be written
out to.  This call will also show the frequency of each vocabulary word in your
corpus.


=back


=head1 REQUIRED

This module requires the following modules:

    SDBM_File
    Storable
    PDL

The first two of these are needed for creating disk-based database records for the
VSM and LSA models.  The third is needed for calculating the SVD of the
term-frequency matrix. (PDL stands for Perl Data Language.)

=head1 EXAMPLES

See the 'examples' directory in the distribution for the scripts listed below:

=over

=item B<For Basic VSM-Based Retrieval:>

For basic VSM-based model construction and retrieval, run the script:

    retrieve_with_VSM.pl

=item B<For Basic LSA-Based Retrieval:>

For basic LSA-based model construction and retrieval, run the script:

    retrieve_with_LSA.pl

Both of the above scripts will store the corpus models created in disk-based
databases.

=item B<For VSM-Based Retrieval with a Disk-Stored Model:>

If you have previously run a script like C<retrieve_with_VSM.pl> and no intervening
code has modified the disk-stored VSM model of the corpus, you can run the script

    retrieve_with_disk_based_VSM.pl

This would obviously work faster at retrieval since the VSM model would NOT need to
constructed for each new query.

=item B<For LSA-Based Retrieval with a Disk-Stored Model:>

If you have previously run a script like C<retrieve_with_LSA.pl> and no intervening
code has modified the disk-stored LSA model of the corpus, you can run the script

    retrieve_with_disk_based_LSA.pl

The retrieval performance of such a script would be faster since the LSA model would
NOT need to be constructed for each new query.

=item B<For Precision and Recall Calculations with VSM:>

To experiment with precision and recall calculations for VSM retrieval, run the
script:

    calculate_precision_and_recall_for_VSM.pl

Note that this script will carry out its own estimation of relevancy judgments ---
which in most cases would not be a safe thing to do.

=item B<For Precision and Recall Calculations with LSA:>

To experiment with precision and recall calculations for LSA retrieval, run the
script:

    calculate_precision_and_recall_for_LSA.pl

Note that this script will carry out its own estimation of relevancy judgments ---
which in most cases would not be a safe thing to do.


=item B<For Precision and Recall Calculations for VSM with
Human-Supplied Relevancies:>

Precision and recall calculations for retrieval accuracy determination are best
carried out with human-supplied judgments of relevancies of the documents to queries.
If such judgments are available, run the script:

    calculate_precision_and_recall_from_file_based_relevancies_for_VSM.pl

This script will print out the average precisions for the different test queries and
calculate the MAP metric of retrieval accuracy.

=item B<For Precision and Recall Calculations for LSA with
Human-Supplied Relevancies:>

If human-supplied relevancy judgments are available and you wish to experiment with
precision and recall calculations for LSA-based retrieval, run the script:

    calculate_precision_and_recall_from_file_based_relevancies_for_LSA.pl

This script will print out the average precisions for the different test queries and
calculate the MAP metric of retrieval accuracy.

=item B<To carry out significance tests on the retrieval precision results with
Randomization or with Student's Paired t-Test:>

    significance_testing.pl  randomization

or

    significance_testing.pl  t-test

Significance testing consists of forming a null hypothesis that the two retrieval
algorithms you are considering are the same from a black-box perspective and then
calculating what is known as a C<p-value>.  If the C<p-value> is less than, say,
0.05, you reject the null hypothesis.

=item B<To calculate a similarity matrix for all the documents in your corpus:>

    calculate_similarity_matrix_for_all_docs.pl

or

    calculate_similarity_matrix_for_all_normalized_docs.pl

The former uses regular document vectors for calculating the similarity between every
pair of documents in the corpus. And the latter uses normalized document vectors for
the same purpose.  The document order used for row and column indexing of the matrix
corresponds to the alphabetic ordering of the document names in the corpus directory.

=back


=head1 EXPORT

None by design.

=head1 SO THAT YOU DO NOT LOSE RELEVANCY JUDGMENTS

You have to be careful when carrying out Precision verses Recall calculations if you
do not wish to lose the previously created relevancy judgments. Invoking the method
C<estimate_doc_relevancies()> in your own script will cause the file C<relevancy.txt>
to be overwritten.  If you have created a relevancy database and stored it in a file
called, say, C<relevancy.txt>, you should make a backup copy of this file before
executing a script that calls C<estimate_doc_relevancies()>.

=head1 BUGS

Please notify the author if you encounter any bugs.  When sending email, please place
the string 'VSM' in the subject line to get past my spam filter.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Download the archive from CPAN in any directory of your choice.  Unpack the archive
with a command that on a Linux machine would look like:

    tar zxvf Algorithm-VSM-1.50.tar.gz

This will create an installation directory for you whose name will be
C<Algorithm-VSM-1.50>.  Enter this directory and execute the following commands for a
standard install of the module if you have root privileges:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

If you do not have root privileges, you can carry out a non-standard install the
module in any directory of your choice by:

    perl Makefile.PL prefix=/some/other/directory/
    make
    make test
    make install

With a non-standard install, you may also have to set your PERL5LIB environment
variable so that this module can find the required other modules. How you do that
would depend on what platform you are working on.  In order to install this module in
a Linux machine on which I use tcsh for the shell, I set the PERL5LIB environment
variable by

    setenv PERL5LIB /some/other/directory/lib64/perl5/:/some/other/directory/share/perl5/

If I used bash, I'd need to declare:

    export PERL5LIB=/some/other/directory/lib64/perl5/:/some/other/directory/share/perl5/


=head1 THANKS

Many thanks are owed to Shivani Rao and Bunyamin Sisman for sharing with me their
deep insights in IR.  Version 1.4 was prompted by Zahn Bozanic's interest in
similarity matrix characterization of a corpus. Thanks, Zahn!
