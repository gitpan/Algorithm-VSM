pAlgorithm::VSM --- A pure-Perl implementation for
constructing either a VSM or an LSA model of a software
library/corpus and for using such models for retrieving
document names from the library/corpus in response to the
search words in a query.

The module can also use pre-stored VSM or LSA models of a
library/corpus for faster retrieval.

The module has also been provided with methods for
calculating precision and recall numbers for measuring the
retrieval accuracy for a given library/corpus.

For installation, do the usual

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

if you have root access.  If not, 

    perl Makefile.PL prefix=/some/other/directory/
    make
    make test
    make install
